## Improving Ecosystem Compatibility with Free-Threaded Python

Quansight Labs is working with the Python runtime team at Meta and stakeholders
across the ecosystem to jumpstart work on converting the libraries that make up
the scientific Python and AI/ML stacks to work with the free-threaded (nogil)
build of CPython 3.13. Additionally, we will look at libraries like PyO3
that are needed to interface with CPython from other languages.

Our initial goal is to ensure libraries at the bottom of the stack like
NumPy, pybind11, and Cython are usable with free-threaded CPython. We will also
be updating packaging tools like meson-python needed to support building wheels
for free-threaded CPython. Once those tools and libraries are in a stable
enough state, we will begin looking at libraries higher in the stack.

### What is this repository?

This repository is for coordinating ecosystem-wide work. We will use
this repository to track, understand, and provide documentation for
dealing with issues that we find are common across many
libraries. Issues that are specific to a project should be reported in
that project's issue tracker.

### Building Free-Threaded CPython

Currently we suggest building CPython from source using the latest version of
the CPython `main` branch. See [the
build
instructions](https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/index.html)
in the CPython developer guide. You will need to install [needed third-party
dependencies](https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/index.html#install-dependencies)
before building. To build the free-threaded version of CPython, pass
`--disable-gil` to the `configure` script:

```bash
./configure --with-pydebug --disable-gil
```

If you will be switching Python versions often, it may make sense to
build CPython using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). See
[the `pyenv` folder](pyenv/README.md) in this repository for more details
managing free-threaded and non-free-threaded python installs with pyenv.
