# Handling dependencies that donâ€™t support free-threading

## Build dependencies that may need special consideration

### CFFI

CFFI added support for the free-threaded build of Python 3.14 in version
2.0.0. You can ensure it is installed by passing a version constraint to pip:

```bash
python -m pip install cffi>=2.0.0
```

If you want to force CFFI 2.0.0 to be used as a dependency of a project, you can use the following `pyproject.toml` snippet:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = [
  "cffi>=2.0.0",
]
```

You can also use the `python_version` [environment
marker](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#environment-markers)
to specify the constraint is only valid for Python 3.14 and newer:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = [
  "cffi>=2.0.0; python_version >= '3.14'",
  "cffi; python_version < '3.14'",
]
```

You can declare a runtime dependency in the `project.dependencies` section using
the same syntax.

CFFI does not support the free-threaded build of Python 3.13.

### mypyc

The mypyc bindings generator [has preliminary support for the free-threaded
build](https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc/issues/1038#issuecomment-3249330800) in
the `main` branch of mypyc. If you maintain a package that ships binaries using
mypyc, you should try building wheels using the development branch of mypyc. The
maintainers of mypyc encourage users to ship wheels this way and report issues
if they encounter any.

Usually mypyc is used with projects that can be straightforwardly used in a
pure-python mode. If there is no compiled build available, we suggest using a
pure-python build instead.

### Other bindings generators

Cython, nanobind, pybind11, and PyO3 all fully support the free-threaded
build. See the documentation of those projects for more details about using them
with the free-threaded interpreter.

## Runtime dependencies that don't support free-threading

### Depending on PyYAML - use PyYAML-ft

If your library depends on [PyYAML](https::/github.com/yaml/pyyaml), you will need
to take extra care to use it with free-threaded Python. PyYAML currently does not
support free-threading and has some thread-safety issues. Its maintainers [have
decided to not port PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/830#issuecomment-2342475334)
before free-threading and Cython support for it have been more extensively tested.

That's why we've created a fork of PyYAML with support for free-threading called
[PyYAML-ft](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/pyyaml-ft). PyYAML users can
switch to this fork if they want to test their code with the free-threaded build.

Currently, PyYAML-ft only supports Python 3.13+ and 3.13t+ (i.e. the free-threaded
build of 3.13). To switch to it, you can add the following to your `requirements.txt`:

```requirements.txt
PyYAML; python_version < '3.13'
PyYAML-ft; python_version >= '3.13'
```

If you define your dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, then you can do the following:

```toml
dependencies = [
  "PyYAML; python_version<'3.13'",
  "PyYAML-ft; python_version>='3.13'",
]
```

#### Different module name

PyYAML-ft uses a different module name (namely `yaml_ft`) than upstream PyYAML on
purpose, so that both can be installed in an environment at the same time.

If your library depends on both for different Python versions, you can do the
following for ease of use:

```python
try:
    import yaml_ft as yaml
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    import yaml
```
