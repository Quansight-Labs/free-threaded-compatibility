# Installing a free-threaded Python

To install a free-threaded CPython interpreter, you can either use a pre-built
binary or build CPython from source. The former is quickest to get started
with. Building from source is not too difficult either though, and in case you
hit a bug that may involve CPython itself then you may want to build from
source.


## Binary install options

There are a growing number of options to install a free-threaded interpreter,
from the python.org installers to Linux distro and Conda package managers.

!!! note

    For any of these options, please check after the install succeeds that you
    have a `pip` version that is recent enough (`>=24.1`), and upgrade it if
    that isn't the case. Older `pip` versions will select wheels with the
    `cp313` tag (binary-incompatible) rather than the `cp313t` tag.


### python.org installers

The [python.org downloads page](https://www.python.org/download/pre-releases/)
provides macOS and Windows installers that have experimental support. Note
that you have to customize the install - e.g., for Windows there is a
_Download free-threaded binaries_ checkbox under "Advanced Options".
See also the [Using Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3.13/using/windows.html#installing-free-threaded-binaries)
section of the Python 3.13 docs.


### Linux distros

=== "Fedora"

    Fedora ships a packaged version, which you can install with:
    ```
    sudo dnf install python3.13-freethreading
    ```
    This will install the interpreter at `/usr/bin/python3.13t`.

=== "Nixpkgs"

    Nixpkgs provides cached builds under the [`python313FreeThreading`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=python313FreeThreading&type=packages)
    attribute from NixOS 24.05 and newer.

    With `flakes` enabled the following command will drop you in an ephemeral shell:

    ```
    nix shell nixpkgs#python313FreeThreading
    ```

    Without `flakes`, make sure to update your nixpkgs channel first:

    ```
    sudo nix-channel --update
    nix-shell -p python313FreeThreading
    ```

=== "Ubuntu"

    For Ubuntu you can use the [deadsnakes PPA](https://launchpad.net/%7Edeadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+packages)
    by adding it to your repositories and then installing `python3.13-nogil`:
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3.13-nogil
    ```


### Conda

Conda packages are currently available for macOS arm64 and Linux x86-64 under a
label in the `ad-testing` (`ad` means "anaconda distribution") channel:

```
conda create -n nogil -c defaults -c ad-testing/label/py313_nogil python=3.13
```


## Building from source

Currently we suggest building CPython from source using the latest version of
the CPython `main` branch. See
[the build instructions](https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/index.html)
in the CPython developer guide. You will need to install [needed third-party
dependencies](https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/index.html#install-dependencies)
before building. To build the free-threaded version of CPython, pass
`--disable-gil` to the `configure` script:

```bash
./configure --with-pydebug --disable-gil
```

If you will be switching Python versions often, it may make sense to
build CPython using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). In order to
do that, you can use the following:

```bash
pyenv install --debug 3.13t-dev
```
