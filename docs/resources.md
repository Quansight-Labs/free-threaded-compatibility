# More Resources

Apart from this website, there's a wide list of resources on the
free-threaded build and free-threading topics in general, including
documentation, blog posts, conference talks, and others. We'll
try to keep an up-to-date list here:

- [Sam Gross's EuroPython talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OOJcTp8dqE)
- [PEP 703 design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CXhDb1ygxg-YXNBJNzfzZsDFosB5e6BfnXLlejd9l0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [C API Extension Support for Free Threading HOWTO on docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3.13/howto/free-threading-extensions.html)
- [`ft_utils` documentation](https://facebookincubator.github.io/ft_utils/)
- [PEP 703 initial discussion thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/22606), as
    well as the [follow-up discussion thread](https://discuss.python.org/t/26503)
- [PEP 703 acceptance announcement](https://discuss.python.org/t/37075)
- [Quansight Labs blog post about work on free-threading](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/free-threaded-python-rollout)
- [Simon Willison's post about trying out free-threaded Python on macOS](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/trying-free-threaded-python)

There's also a lot of useful resources on CPython internals, that are not
specific to the free-threaded build:

- [CPython internal docs](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/InternalDocs)
- [Dated tutorial on writing C extension modules](https://llllllllll.github.io/c-extension-tutorial/)
- [Python behind the scenes series](https://tenthousandmeters.com/tag/python-behind-the-scenes/)
- [≈Åukasz Langa's PyCon Thailand talk on the Python 3.13 release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL_kmagVKFQ)
- [Anthony Shaw's PyCon US talk on free-threading and other parallelism concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp5wKOL4L2Q)
